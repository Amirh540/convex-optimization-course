Problem 1 : Effect of Lambda (Regularization Parameter) on L1 Trend Filtering.

Problem 2 : fitting a polynomial regression model to data using polynomial regression for general case with n-point regression with a degree polynomial m that n>m+1.

Problem 3 : Given a matrix A of size 100Ã—200 and a vector b of size 100x1, we want to find a sparse vector X of size 200x1 that satisfies AX=b.
